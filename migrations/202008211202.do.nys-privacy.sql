The COVID Smart NY App protects the privacy of all app users, at all times.\n\n[Protecting your privacy](#_heading=h.rchqyp20r2ki)\n\n[You choose what data you share](#_heading=h.yibyuad7sxh3)\n\n[What data is collected](#_heading=h.wijfpchjvjb)\n\n[Personal data](#_heading=h.f34gvtn95oe8)\n\n[Health and demographic information](#_heading=h.nco0l4v6m4l0)\n\n[IP address](#_heading=h.ymre1slnpq2m)\n\n[Anonymous data](#_heading=h.89swilha78jp)\n\n[Data about how you use the app](#_heading=h.u4kkoz388qbh)\n\n[Data for contact tracing](#_heading=h.h3crx75mnhuk)\n\n[Safe, secure and compliant](#_heading=h.2ev1l86n6alg)\n\n[Deleting your data](#_heading=h.6kze6ccehlfw)\n\n[For more information](#_heading=h.30j0zll)\n\n[Partners](#_heading=h.lwn43wtuwlkt)\n\n## Protecting your privacy\n\nThe app:\n\n- Does not collect your name, address, or any other personally identifiable information\n- Cannot be used to track your location, including whether you are self-isolating or not\n- Can only access information on your phone that you choose to allow\n- Uses random IDs so that the identity of your close contacts is obscured from you and vice versa\n\n## You choose what data you share\n\nIt&#39;s always your choice to:\n\n- Use the app\n- Share data and information with us\n\nYou can:\n\n- Change your preferences about sharing data at any time in the app settings\n- Use parts of the app without sharing any data at all\n- Use, or not use, app features independently\n- Remove or update any information you provided to the app, at any time\n\nAny data that we ask you to share with us is aggregated so that public health professionals learn more about how the virus spreads, how the app itself is being used, and how to best stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\n## What data is collected\n\nThe app collects and uses a combination of personal data and anonymous data.\n\n## Personal data\n\nPersonal data used by the app can be provided by:\n\n- You (if you choose to provide it)\n- Your phone\n\nPersonal data you can choose to provide is your demographic data and health-related data. You don&#39;t have to provide any of this data if you don&#39;t want to.\n\nPersonal data provided automatically by your phone is your IP address. We do not need to use your IP address. We delete this data as soon as your phone sends it to us.\n\n### Health and demographic information\n\nThe app will share with NYSDOH the most recent date that you were in close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus. This is so we can give you the right health advice based on how long ago it has been since you were exposed to the virus.\n\nIf you use the COVID check-in symptom tracker on your phone we will ask you to share:\n\n- The county you live in\n- Your gender\n- Your age range\n- Your race and ethnicity\n- Your symptoms\n\nIf you share this information, it will be used **anonymously** by the NYSDOH for analytical purposes. We can not and do not link this back to you. We use this information to understand more about the spread of the virus through various demographics, and the relationship between the symptoms and the disease itself.\n\nIt&#39;s always your choice if you want to share this data or not. You can change what information you want to share at any time.\n\n### IP address\n\nYour IP address is a unique set of numbers that identifies your phone or computer when you use the internet. IP addresses are used so you can send and receive information online.\n\nYour IP address is automatically shared every time you use an app or visit a website.\n\nWe do not need to use your IP address. We delete it from our server as soon as we receive any data that you share with us from the app.\n\n## Anonymous data\n\nThe anonymous data we collect includes:\n\n- Data about how you use the app\n- Data we use for contact tracing\n\n### Data about how you use the app\n\nWe collect data about how you use the app. This is called &quot;app metric data&quot;.\n\nWe collect it to improve the app and to understand:\n\n- How the app is being used\n- Its impact in helping slow the spread of the virus\n\nThis app metric data does not reveal your identity, but it&#39;s your choice if you want to share this data or not.\n\n## Data for COVID Alert\n\nFor COVID Alert to work, COVID Smart NY uses technology developed by Apple and Google called Exposure Notification.\n\nExposure Notification enables your phone to generate and share anonymous IDs. These anonymous IDs are shared when you are in contact with other app users.\n\nYou can read more about the Exposure Notification system on the [Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing) or [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/) website.\n\nThe app uses this anonymous data to tell:\n\n- How long you are close to another anonymous app user\n- The strength of other anonymous app users&#39; Bluetooth signal, to work out how far apart you were from them\n\nThis data will remain on your phone. It cannot be accessed by anyone unless you choose to share it. You will be asked if you want to share it with the NYSDOH if you test positive for coronavirus.\n\nAnonymous IDs shared with the NYSDOH are automatically deleted every 14 days. You can manually delete the app and all data held by it whenever you want.\n\nWe have worked with Apple and Google to ensure that the COVID Alert functionality works effectively across the largest number of phones possible.\n\n## Safe, secure and compliant\n\nWe have created the app based on HIPAA guidelines and NYSDOH standards on data privacy and protection.\n\nThis means the app:\n\n- Is safe and secure to use\n- Is legally compliant\n- Meets the standards expected to keep data secure and confidential\n\nContact tracing on the app is fully decentralized. The matching of anonymous random IDs happens on your phone. This means no one can track your location, your movements or who you have been in contact with.\n\n## Deleting your data\n\nYou can choose to delete the app and your data at any stage.\n\nTo do this:\n\n1. Go to &#39;Settings&#39; in the app.\n2. Select &#39;Delete my Data&#39;.\n3. Tap on the red button &quot;Delete my Data&quot;.\n4. Tap &quot;Confirm&quot; in the dialog box that comes up. **This step is final and the data can not be recovered.**\n\nIf the government declares that the pandemic is over, the app will no longer work. You will be encouraged to delete the app and all of its data. It will no longer be available to download from any of the app stores.\n\n## For more information\n\nFor more information on the overall NYS Department of Health Privacy Policy, please visit the following link:\n\n[https://www.health.ny.gov/about/privacy.htm](https://www.health.ny.gov/about/privacy.htm)\n\nFor further questions, please reach out to [privacy@health.ny.gov](mailto:privacy@health.ny.gov).\n\n## Partners\n\nOrganizations from around the world worked together to develop the COVID Smart NY App. They included partnerships around:\n\n- Project governance and delivery\n- Research\n- Technology\n- Commercial\n\n**Project governance and delivery**\n\n- New York State Department of Health\n- Tech:NYC\n\n**Research**\n\n- Columbia University\n- Cornell Tech\n- Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Private Automated Contact Tracing (MIT-PACT)\n\n**Technology partners**\n\n- Apple\n- Google\n- Amazon Web Services\n- Linux Foundation Public Health\n\n**Commercial partners**\n\n- NearForm, Inc\n \"}');
